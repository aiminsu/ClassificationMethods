## Machine Learning Basics
This project will focus on some machine learning basic problems, including classification, regression, clustering, etc. Some commonly used methods will be explained and implemented for study.

Note that, instead of implementing every algorithms from scratch, I will load the methods from some high-level machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn and mlxtend.
